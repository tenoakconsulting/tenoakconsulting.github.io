A quick google search will provide various general rules of thumb, with most providing some version of, "It depends on your business, but we recommend 5-10% of gross sales." Even [the SBA gives a general recommendation of 7-8%][sba] for small businesses.

This is common advice, but can we do better? Can we provide a more precise answer that is perfectly applicable to every situation?

## Towards A Better Question

What if we changed the question just a bit?

> How much should you spend on marketing that provides a negative ROI?

Well, that's easy: $0. Always and forever. There's no case for any business to spend money on marketing that provides a negative return. Ever.

How about this?

> How much should you spend on marketing that provides a positive ROI?

Well, that's pretty easy too: you should spend as much as your cash flow and capacity can support. In every case, no matter what, you want a positive return.

Precise answers, applicable in every situation.

## An Incomplete Question

"How much should I spend on marketing?" is a question with two possible answers:

* $0
* Literally every dollar your cash flow and capacity allow

It's an incomplete question that leaves us trying to find some compromise between 0 and Infinity. It's a question that can't be answered, evidenced by vague answers settled on as "best practice" and "general rule of thumb", phrases which are often code for "just do what everyone else does because no one knows."

## The Right Question

The right question to ask, after deciding that marketing is the correct place to focus, is:

> Will this marketing provide a positive ROI?

This is clearly a difficult question to answer. But it is the **right** question to ask. It's unlikely we'll ever be able to answer this question precisely, but the upside is we are dealing with the actual problem instead of choosing an easier question that skirts the conflict.

Given the difficulty of the question, I ask the following questions and regularly use the answers to refine my understanding:

* Why am I convinced this marketing will provide a negative/positive return?
* How can I test my expectations?
* What can I learn from running this marketing, even if the expected return is not achieved?

Focusing on the right question requires significantly more focus and thought than just following general advice. But the company that only spends 2% of revenue to get the same value that everyone else pays 7-8% for has a significant advantage. And the company that gets a positive return on 15% spend is going to have a similar advantage over everyone else that blindly follows best practices and limits their spend to 7-8%.

What would your business look like with such an advantage?
